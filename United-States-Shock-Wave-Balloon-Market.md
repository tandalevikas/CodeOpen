These arteries are essential for proper blood flow to the legs and can become narrowed or blocked due to atherosclerosis, leading to critical health issues such as claudication, rest pain, and tissue loss. Shock wave balloon therapy is increasingly used in this subsegment because of its ability to treat these lesions effectively without resorting to invasive surgery. The therapy works by delivering energy through the balloon catheter, which helps to break down the plaque and restore the flow of blood.This application is particularly important because iliac artery lesions can lead to severe complications if left untreated, including gangrene or limb amputation. As the prevalence of atherosclerosis and PAD increases in the United States, the need for innovative and effective treatments like shock wave balloon therapy will continue to grow. The convenience and efficacy of this method offer a promising solution for patients suffering from these types of lesions, contributing to the overall expansion of the shock wave balloon market in the U.S. This segment is expected to see increased investment as more healthcare providers adopt these advanced procedures for vascular interventions.</p><h2>Femoral Artery Lesions</h2><p>Femoral artery lesions refer to blockages that occur in the femoral artery, a major blood vessel in the thigh that supplies blood to the lower leg. These blockages are typically caused by the accumulation of fatty deposits or plaque in the artery walls, which can obstruct blood flow and lead to painful conditions such as intermittent claudication. Shock wave balloon therapy has emerged as a preferred treatment for femoral artery lesions due to its ability to deliver precise shock waves to the affected area, breaking down plaque and improving blood flow without the need for invasive surgery. The use of shock wave balloons in femoral artery lesions can help restore blood circulation, alleviate pain, and prevent more severe complications like limb amputation.The femoral artery lesion segment has witnessed rapid growth as more healthcare providers seek minimally invasive solutions to treat vascular diseases. With the rising prevalence of peripheral artery disease in the U.S., driven by lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking, this subsegment of the market is expected to expand further. Shock wave balloon technology offers a practical alternative to traditional surgical methods, providing patients with faster recovery times and fewer complications. The increasing recognition of these benefits is expected to drive further adoption of shock wave balloon therapy for femoral artery lesions in the U.S. market.</p><h2>Femor-Popliteal Artery Lesions</h2><p>Femor-popliteal artery lesions affect the segment of the artery that runs from the thigh (femoral artery) to the knee (popliteal artery). Blockages in this region are particularly concerning because they can severely impair blood flow to the lower extremities, leading to pain, mobility issues, and in extreme cases, tissue damage or amputation. Shock wave balloon therapy has proven to be an effective treatment for these lesions by using targeted shock waves to disrupt the blockage and restore circulation. This application is critical in treating patients with advanced PAD, as the femor-popliteal artery is a major vessel that plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy blood flow to the legs.The femor-popliteal artery lesions segment represents a substantial part of the U.S. shock wave balloon market. As the number of patients diagnosed with PAD continues to rise, particularly in older populations or those with comorbidities like diabetes, the need for effective, minimally invasive therapies like shock wave balloon treatment is expected to grow.
